            <h3>Q1: What is the difference between sessionstorage and localstorage?</h3>
            <h4 class="fw-normal">The main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is that the localStorage
                stores data with no
                expiration date, while the sessionStorage stores data from one session.

                LocalStorage as it's called, it's local storage for the browsers, it can save up to 10MB, SessionStorage
                does likewise, yet as its name saying, it's session based and will be deleted after closing your
                browser, additionally can store less then LocalStorage, as up to 5MB</h4>

            <h3>Q2: What is the difference between Global scope and Block scope?</h3>
            <h4 class="fw-normal">A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all
                functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by
                any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.On the other hand we can access blocks scope
                item only into the blocks scope.</h4>

            <h3>Q3: How to work js event loop?</h3>
            <h4 class="fw-normal">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue.
                If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to
                the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</h4>
